    "# Assignment 4\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will build a model to predict length of stay of 3 days or more  (as a binary classification outcome) using a sample from the Texas hospital discharge dataset. We will evaluate your model performance using a hold-out dataset that is kept from you.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will generate a full analysis report, including the descriptive stats and missingness patterns, train and evaluate the model, indicate the optimal hyperparameters, explain the model, and evaluate fairness on `sex`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some instructions of this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You should use this checklist for reporting (and complete the checklist and include it as part of the submission):\n",
    "[Journal of Medical Internet Research - Consolidated Reporting Guidelines for Prognostic and Diagnostic Machine Learning Modeling Studies: Development and Validation (jmir.org)](https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e48763)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can choose which modeling technique you want to use or come up with an ensemble if you want. It is up to you. You can try and compare different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In most publications you need to explain why you did not use a simpler modeling technique, so you should have an logistic regression model as a baseline to compare against.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You should submit the workbook, the checklist, and the model (see details below). For submission, __only submit your best model__. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. We have 10 bonus points to distribute among the class based on a ranking of how well your model predicts on the holdout. Bonus points 4,3,2,1 for the top four."
